# lashes
A professional lashes vendor.

My boss asked me to create a B2B website to sell eyelashes. How I did to creat the website?

Frstly, I made a keywords research by the keyword planner of <a href="https://ads.google.com/home/">google adwords</a>. The purpose of do the keyword research is to find the easist keywords to do SEO.
The second step is to choose the platform to do the website. I know <a href="https://www.joomla.org/">Joomla</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.com">wordpress</a>, and shopify. 
The style of the website is a B2B website. So, Joomla is the best chooice. Joomla is a free platform, and it's easier to do SEO. Besides, it's easy to use.
Then, I prepared the components, plugins, and template that needed. Such as <a href="https://virtuemart.net/">virtuemart</a>-a commercal component, <a href="https://www.akeeba.com/">akeeba</a>-a backup component. I didn't use too much plugins, because the less plugins you use, the speed will be faster.
Next, I used <a href="https://www.wampserver.com/en/">wampserver</a> created a database on my local computer. How I created a datebase on my local computer? The address is localhost/phpmyadmin. The user is root, and the keyword is null.
And, I installed joomla on my computer. How I did? Create a floder under the html floder of wampserver. Rename the floder such as lamylash. Copy the Joomla Archive to the new floder. And unzip this compressed package of Joomla. Then, open a browser such as firefox. And, open the page localhost/lamylash. Then, install the joomla step by step.
Then, I installed the virtuemart, language plugin, template, and akeeba.
Next, I created categories, home page, products page, about us page, contact us page, and blog page.
And, I filled in keywords, and meta description of every page. Every picture were optimized by <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html">photoshop</a>.
When I have created the website on my local computer. I need to upload the website to the server. I used akeeba to create a archive of the website. It's earier than creat the archive by ourself. Because, we need to download the datebase of the website. And, copy the datebase into the intallation floder to cover the sample datebase. And, create a archive by using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>.
I use <a href="https://www.bluehost.com/">bluehost</a> as the website server.
And, I bought the domain lamylash.com. 
Then, I created a floder that named lamylash on bluehost.
Then, I created a datebase on the server.
And, uploaded the archive to the floder of server. And, unzip this website on the server.
Then, I opened lamylash.com and intalled the website.
Then, the website has been optimized and a 301 redirect has been made.
Finally, the website of <a href="https://www.lamylash.com">lashes vendor</a>-lamylash.com is online.
